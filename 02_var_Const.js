// constant declaration using **const** keyword

   const ConstName = "A";

// variable declaration using **var** and **let** keyword  

    var VariableName = "A";
         // Not good practice because **var** has scope problem
    let Variable1Name = "A";    // good practice

// Also way to declare variable 
    Name ="A";  // Not good practice


// display output on the console using syntax of js

   console.log(ConstName);       
   console.log(VariableName);
   console.log(Variable1Name);

// Another way to display out on the console in the **form of table**:--

  console.table([ConstName, VariableName, Variable1Name]);  // syntax 

/* we can not ReAssign constName because it is constant*
i.e  ConstName="singh"  // not allowed */
